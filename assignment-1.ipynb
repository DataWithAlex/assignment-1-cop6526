    "### Question-1 (10 points): Which code use cache better? Why? Please test the execution time of the two code versions, which code runs faster? Does this result match your original thought?\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the two versions of the code, we find that `version 1` utilizes cache more efficiently from a lower completion time from `version 1` (11.70s) compared to `version 2` (13.49). The reason this is the case has to do with how the loop is formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Version 1` is accessing the array in a sequential order `arr[i * 1000 + j]` which means that the data is being stored contiguously in memory allowing for CPU cache to load a block of data once and reuse it multiple times. This is because this code leverages the phenomenon known as **Spatial Locality**, where consectuvie memory access are likely to be within the same cacheline, minimizing cache misses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversly, `Version 2` is accessing the array in a strided pattern `arr[j * 1000 + i]` which means that the code needs to jump around in memory while doing the computation. This suggests that the code is not leveraging Spatial Locaility well, leading to more frequent cache misses and therefore lower performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of my original thought, I did not have a preconception for which one would run faster. I did not consider how switching the loop from `arr[i * 1000 + j]` to `arr[j * 1000 + i]` would have an impact on how cache is utilized, for I thought the python intepreter has its own mechanisims for increasing cache efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-2 (10 points): Does Python utilize CPU cache well? You can investigate this topic by reading online discussion using google.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I read is that Python is implemented through `CPython`, which actively translates python code into C and compiles it into bytecode. This is different from lower level languages like `C` which directly do the operations, which make it more efficient. Here are some specific details that make Python inefficient at utilizing CPU Cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object Allocation and Deallocation: Allocation refers to the process of reserving a block of memory for a program to use, where if a new variable is made, it is where it is stored. Whereas Deallocation refers to freeing up that memory for it to be used by another program. Python frequently allocates and deallocates objects in an inefficient manner, where every time a new object is made or removed, it requires several memory operations and disrupts cache locality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable-Sized Integers: lower level languages like `C` have fixed-size integers which help with cache efficiency. Python defaults to variable-sized integers which uses more memory, and decrease cache efficiency. Whenever python does operations on these variable-sized integers, additional memory access is required beyond the cache to manage the objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python uses GIL so only one thread can be used at a time to execute python bytecode. We have computers that have multiple cores (e.g., my Mac has access to 10 cores), and Python is unable to maximize CPU efficiency across the cores when performing operations. Cache operations specifically benefit from multi-threading, which can't occur when running python code due to the GIL. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When we are comparing the execution times, we find that for both code blocks it is significantly faster using numpy. For the `version 1` code, without numpy it compiled in 11.70s and with it 0.060 (i.e., 195x faster); For the `version 2` code, without numpy is compiled in 13.49s and with it 0.069s (i.e., 195x faster). \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of why it is much faster, here are a few explanations: \n",
    "\n",
    "numpy's use of vectorization: numPy leverages vectorized operations where it applied a function to an entire array at once, reather than iterating through each element one-by-one. This reduces the overhead associated with python loops, allowing for much faster computation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Contiguity: Since numPy uses arrays, they are stored in contiguous blocks of memory which is cache-friendly. This reduces the number of cache misses compared to using the default python arrays, \n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying C Implementation: NumPy is direectly implemented in C, which allows use to leverage specific CPU-level instructions. For instance, NumPy specifies that variables should be fixed-size data types (e.g., int64) which minimizes memory allocation and improves cache utilization. \n",

    "The output details a parallel matrix-vector multiplication using MPI, where Rank 0 (the master process) generates a random matrix and vector, broadcasts the vector, and scatters parts of the matrix to all processes, including itself. Both Rank 0 and Rank 1 then perform their local matrix-vector multiplications and log the partial results, which are later gathered back to Rank 0.\n",

The total time for the entire parallel operation, including all communication steps, is 0.016090 seconds, demonstrating efficient parallel processing and minimal overall execution time."
